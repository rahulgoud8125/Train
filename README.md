# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to find patterns, trends, and survival insights.

## 📚 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`)
2. Checked missing values, data types, and summary statistics
3. Performed univariate analysis:
   - Survival rate
   - Age distribution
   - Passenger class distribution
4. Performed bivariate analysis:
   - Survival vs Gender
   - Survival vs Passenger Class
   - Boxplots of Age and Fare
5. Multivariate Analysis:
   - Correlation heatmap
   - Pairplot analysis
6. Visualized insights using multiple graphs

## 📝 Key Insights
- Female survival rate is significantly higher
- 1st class passengers had the highest survival probability
- Higher fare correlates with higher survival
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances
- Pclass is negatively correlated with Fare
